# SUDOKU USING CPP

This project was created to solve sudoku puzzles using Backtracking methodology. The project is still a work in progress.

## IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE

- Giving inputs to the code is a tedious process, it would be better if we could read data and feed into the algorithm to solve it.
- It would be better to exercise the idea of running a live-server where the algorithm could be hosted which'll solve the sudoku and return the results through some format (JSON or XML) and providing an Interactive frontend would be amazing.
- Since the code is fairly straightforward it can also be re-written in other languages to develop applications involving the game, sudoku.
- Rewriting the project without `using namespace std;`
